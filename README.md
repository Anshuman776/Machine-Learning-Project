# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to provide an efficient tool for buyers and sellers to estimate property values.

## Features
- Predict house prices using machine learning algorithms.
- Interactive user interface for inputting property details.
- Visualization of model performance and predictions.
- Support for various regression algorithms.

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshuman776/Machine-Learning-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Input the required property details in the interface.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the estimated house price.
